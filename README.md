## Repo

* Repository = repo
* Repo have the thing called **"commit new file"** in the bottom of the screen = save
* On the top of the screen of **"README.md"** you can separate the section of it (like pages of a chapter?) = single flie
* Right corner is your edit button = fix anything you will like
* There is a section for comment usually for collabrating with other people to help keep track what you added or took out

## Commit

* Right corner is your edit button = fix anything you will like
* There is also view history --> a button called "history" = it can show you what you changed that moment
* crazy number at the right side of your history --> "commit hash" = an unique identifier for the particular commit.
